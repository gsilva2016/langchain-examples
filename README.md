This repository contains a set of Intel AI PC examples where each part of the workload  can be distributed across the edge, on-prem, or a CSP.

| Demo  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| hybrid_architecture_swapping | Demonstrates running LangChain based applications using hybrid architectures. Demo-1 can be run on an Intel AI PC and distribute pieces of the pipeline across on-prem edge servers and/or CSP managed AI services. Demo-1 (run-demo-1.sh) will perform three tests to demonstrate this with LangChain.  |
